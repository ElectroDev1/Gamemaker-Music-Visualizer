# Gamemaker-Music-Visualizer
A program made to easily test songs directly in-engine, in it you can preview songs from anywhere in your pc, test loop points and more, all values can be copied and put into your projects in a click, and everything is saved for future uses.

# How to use
You can load files from anywhere in the system or from already used songs, everything is saved in an .ini file in the game's directory.
Set loop points by dragging them on the timeline, loop end defines where the song will stop and go back to the loop start, and I'm sure you can figure out what loop start means.
Music files must be in .ogg format.
